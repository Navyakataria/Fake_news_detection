Fake News Detection using Machine Learning:

a) Built a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake using labeled datasets from Kaggle.
b) Performed data preprocessing including text cleaning, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF/CountVectorizer).
c) Experimented with multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes) to compare accuracy and performance.
d) Achieved 99% accuracy and improved model interpretability using confusion matrices and evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
